"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising putito putito was
 born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the 
 great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids 
 pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue 
 pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone 
 who loves or pursues or desires to obtain putito putito of itself, because it is putito putito, but because occasionally 
 circumstances occur in which toil and putito putito can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
  example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage 
  from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has 
  no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a putito putito that produces no resultant pleasure?"
